Algorithmia had done a lot of the heavy lifting for me, but that original Amazon Web Services machine image eventually fell into disrepair and I couldn’t operate it anymore. For the last couple of years I bounced around trying different text transfer services, and kicking the tires on a variety of Tensorflow models that were cheaper to operate, but none of them produced the same results as some of the earlier models I had developed. To make things worse, I had accidentally deleted some of my earlier models, leaving me pretty determined to produce my own machine learning model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, after much experimentation I finally created one that works as well as the first model I had. Actually, it is the same model, I just managed to find the original source of how to build it, followed their instructions and then I was able to get up and going. I will do a formal write-up on it citing my sources, and walking through how I did what I did. I just haven’t had time to write it up – each time I go to operate it and apply to my current batch of images I have to retrain myself on how it all works. Eventually I’ve carve out enough time to write up an on-boarding document for it, and publish it here on the blog for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just looking to draw a line in the sand here on the updates for when I finally got full control over how I train my models. So when I’m looking back I can better understand what images were from the first batch of models, what came the years in between, and what has been produced as part of this new process. There are distinct differences between each of the phases, how I trained each model, the length of time, and ultimately how I chose to apply them. Back in 2016 I had the money to run a GPU server for two months straight. I don’t have those kind of resources today, but I’m regularly funneling money into it whenever I can. Then step back occasionally and organized what I’ve produced into collections that I can use to showcase what I am seeing in my head when it comes to how AI, ML, APIs, and the Internet are being used to distort not just our online worlds, but our physical worlds as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kin Lane</name></author><category term="Collections" /><category term="Models" /><summary type="html">I have bounced around quite a bit from the original Tensorflow model I was using when I started this work.

How they are being &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinlane.com/2017/02/06/algorithmic-reflections-on-the-immigration-debate/&quot;&gt;used to distort the immigration debate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/14/the-russian-propaganda-distortion-field-around-the-white-house/&quot;&gt;how the current administration is being influenced and p0wned by Russian propaganda&lt;/a&gt;. I find shedding light on how algorithms are directly influencing a variety of conversations using machine learning a fun pastime. I’m also interested in finding ways to shine a light on what gets filtered out, omitted, censored, or completely forgotten by algorithms, and their authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my latest filters I’ve trained using TensorFlow is called “Feed the People”. It is an early 20th century Soviet propaganda poster that I do not know much history behind, but I feel provides a compelling point, while also providing an attractive and usable color palette and textures–I will have to do more research on the back story. I took this propaganda poster and trained a TensorFlow machine learning model for about 24 hours on an AWS EC2 GPU instance, which cost me about $18.00 for the entire process–leaving me with a ML model I can apply to any image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/markets/feed-the-people-economics.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;98%&quot; style=&quot;padding: 15px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had my trained machine learning model I applied to a handful of images, including one I took of the economist Adam Smith statue in Edinburgh, Scotland–which interestingly was commissioned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith_Institute&quot;&gt;the Adam Smith Institute (ASI)&lt;/a&gt;, a neoliberal (formerly libertarian) think tank and lobbying group based in the United Kingdom, named after Adam Smith, a Scottish moral philosopher and classical economist in 2003. Taking the essence of the “feed the people” propaganda and algorithmically transferring it an image of the famous economist from the 18th century that was installed on the city streets by a neoliberal think tank in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m super fascinated by how algorithms influence markets, from high speed trading, all the way to how stories about markets are spread on Facebook by investors, and libertarian and neoliberal influencers. Algorithms are being used to distort, contort, p0wn, influence and create new markets. I am continuing to trying to understand how propaganda and ideology is influencing these algorithms, but more importantly highlighting the conversations, and people that are ultimately left behind in the cracks as algorithms continue to consume our digital and physical worlds, and disrupt everything along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kin Lane</name></author><category term="Kin Lane" /><category term="Algorotoscope" /><summary type="html">I’ve been playing with different ways of visualizing the impact that algorithms are making on our lives.

I wanted to get better at organizing some of the more interesting images I had produced using specific Tensorflow machine learning models. Much of my work is pretty random without much connection between the image I trained my models on and the images I applied my models to–they are just making for some interesting colors and textures. However, along the way I have been trying to squeeze more meaning as well as texture and colors out of the models I am training as well as the photos I take, and apply these models to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing my work I came across five separate filters I feel like are beginning to get at what I am seeing when it comes to algorithmic distortion on the web. Providing a collection of images that I feel represent this work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/collections/the-persistence-of-memory/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Persistence of Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - One of the first ML models I trained using Dali’s thought provoking work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/collections/copper-circuit/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copper Circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - One of my earlier models that I trained by leaving the world of art and using objects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/collections/nazi-invasion/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nazi Invasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Produced during a darker period after the Charlottesville rally rattled our world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/collections/nazi-poster/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nazi Poster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A continuation of that work showing how the web is being used to promote hate and fear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/collections/russian-propaganda/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian Propaganda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Looking at how Russian propaganda is disseminated online, all the way up to the White House.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several other collections simmering behind the scenes. I’ve bee producing some interesting photos and continue to generate ML models from interesting subjects.  I’ll add photos to these collections as new ones emerge, and I’ll add other collections when I get enough photos to round off each collection, and enough words to tell the story. It just makes me happy to surface some of these older images I had created, but were beginning to get buried by each newer wave of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not happy with the majority of what I am producing, however I do have full control over how I train my models, as well as apply them to images–I haven’t for a couple of years now. This will help stabilize my work, helping me mine specific topics, time periods, and imagery. Currently I am looking for ways that I can help visualize how technology is being used to distort and provide disinformation when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will take me a while to focus in on some meaningful images that I can use, as well as take some new photos of common aspects of the world we live in right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kin Lane</name></author><category term="Kin Lane" /><category term="Algorotoscope" /><summary type="html">After organizing a couple of the latest batches of images I produced as part of my algorotoscope work I wanted to step back and see what I had made.

I needed a hands-on project that would allow me to play with two overlapping slices of the machine learning pie–working with images and video. I wanted to understand what people meant when they said texture transfer or object recognition, and quantify the differences between machine learning providers, pulling the curtain back a little on a portion of machine learning, helping establish some transparency and observability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorotoscope allows me shine a light on machine learning, while also shining a light on the world of algorithms. I’m still learning what is possible, but the motivations behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/06/algorithmic-reflections-on-the-immigration-debate/&quot;&gt;my Ellis Island Nazi Poster reflection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/14/the-russian-propaganda-distortion-field-around-the-white-house/&quot;&gt;my White House Russian propaganda leaflet snapshot&lt;/a&gt; are meant to help me understand machine learning texture transfer models, and apply them to images in a way that helps demonstrate how algorithms are obfuscating the physical and digital world around us. Showcasing that algorithms are being used to distort the immigration debate, our elections, and almost every other aspect of our professional and personal lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algorotoscope/stories/crypto-machine-bletchley_copper_circuit.png&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;padding: 25px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand technology by using it. Black box algorithms seem to be indistinguishable from magic for many folks, while they scare the hell out of me. Not because they contain magic, but because they contain exploitation, bias, corruption, privacy, and security nightmares. It is important to me that we understand the levers, knobs, dials, and gears behind algorithms. I am looking to use my algorotoscope work help reduce the distortion field that often surrounds algorithms, and how their various incarnations are being marketed. I want my readers to understand that nothing they read, no image they see, or video they watch is free of algorithmic influence, and that algorithms are making the decision about what you see, as well as what we do not see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algorotscope is all about using machine learning to help us visualize the impact that algorithms are making on our world. I have no idea where the work is headed, except that I will keep working to generate relevant machine learning models trained on relevant images, then experiment with the application of these models as filters on images and video in a way that tells a story about how algorithms are distorting our world, and shifting how we view things both on and offline. I’m looking to move my &lt;a href=&quot;http://apievangelist.com&quot;&gt;API Evangelist storytelling to use 100% algorotscope images&lt;/a&gt;, as I keep scratching the surface of how algorithms are invading our lives via the web, devices, and everyday objects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kin Lane</name></author><category term="Algorotoscope" /><category term="Algorithms" /><summary type="html">I started doing my algorotoscope work to better understand machine learning.

I'm trying to see things from different vantage points and develop a better understanding of how texture styles can be put to use in the regular world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am enjoying using image style filters in my writing. It gives me kind of a gamified layer to my photography and drone hobby that allows me to create actual images I can use in my work as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://apievangelist.com&quot;&gt;API Evangelist&lt;/a&gt;. Having unique filtered images available for use in my writing is valuable to me--enough to justify the couple hundreds of dollars I spend each month on AWS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know why I like applying image styles to my photos, but why do others? Most of the image filters out there we've seen from apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://prisma-ai.com/&quot;&gt;Prisma&lt;/a&gt; are focused on fine art. Training image style transfer machine learning models on popular art that people are already familiar with. I guess this is allows people to apply the characteristics of art they like to the photographic layer of our increasingly digital lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_blue_brush.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it feels like some sort of art placebo. A way of superficially and algorithmic injecting what are brain tells us is artsy to our fairly empty, digital photo reality. Taking photos in real time isn't satisfying enough anymore. We need to distract ourselves from the world by applying reality to our digitally documented physical world--almost the opposite of augmented reality if there is such a thing. Getting lost in the ability to look at the real world through the algorithmic lens of our online life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_alien_goggles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are stealing the essence the meaningful, tangible art from our real world, and digitizing it. We take this essense and algorithmically apply it our everyday life trying to add some color, some texture, but not too much. We need the photos to still be meaningful, and have context in our life, but we need to be able to spray an algorithmic lacquer of meaning on our intangible lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_crunch_paper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more filters we have, the more lenses we have to look at the exact same moment we live each day. We go to work. We go to school. We see the same scenery, the same people, and the same pictures each day. Now we are able to algorithmic shift, distort, and paint the picture of our lives we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_dark_dali.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can add color to our life. We are being trained to think we can change the palette, and are in control over our lives. We can colorize the old World War 2 era photos of our day, and choose whether we want to color within, or outside the lines. Our lives don't have to be just binary 1s and 0s, and black or white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_kandinsky_bv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, picture by picture, algorithmic transfer by algorithmic transfer, the way we see the world changes. We no longer settle for the way things are, the way our mobile phone camera catches it. The digital version is the image we share with my friends, family, and the world. It should always be the most brilliant, the most colorful, and the painting that catches their eye and makes them stand in front of on the wall of your Facebook feed captivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_sunday.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer will remember what reality looks like, or what art looks like. Our collective social media memory will dictate what the world looks like. The number of likes will determine what is artistic, and what is beautiful or ugly. The algorithm will only show us what images match the world it wants us to see. Algorithmically, artistically painting the inside walls of our digital bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_blue_circuit_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the sensors that stimulate us when we see photos will be well worn. They will be well programmed, with known inputs, and predictable outputs. The algorithm will be able to deliver exactly what we need, and correctly predict what we will need next. Scheduling up and queuing the next fifty possible scenarios--with exactly the right colors, textures, and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/algo-rotoscope/stories/art-museum/art-museum_copper_circuit_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we see art will be forever changed by the algorithm. Our machines will never see art. Our machines will never know art. Our machines will only be able to transfer the characteristics we see and deliver them into newer, more relevant, timely, and meaningful images. Distilling down the essence of art into binary, and programming us to think this synthetic art is meaningful, and still applies to our physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I think people like applying artistic image filters to their mobile photos because it is the opposite of augmented reality. They are trying to augment their digital (hopes of reality) presence with the essence of what we (algorithm) think matters to use in the world. This process isn't about training a model to see art like some folks may tell you. It is about distilling down some of the most simple aspects of what our eyes see as art, and give this algorithm to our mobile phones and social networks to apply to the photograph digital logging of our physical reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like this is about reprogramming people. It is about reprogramming what stimulates you. Automating an algorithmic view of what matters when it comes to art, and applying it to a digital view of matters in our daily worlds, via our social networks. Just one more area of our life where we are allowing algorithms to reprogram us, and bend our reality to be more digital.&lt;/p&gt;

We no longer will remember what reality looks like, or what art looks like. Our collective social media memory will dictate what the world looks like. The number of likes will determine what is artistic, and what is beautiful or ugly. The algorithm will only show us what images match the world it wants us to see. Algorithmically, artistically painting the inside walls of our digital bubble. Eventually, the sensors that stimulate us when we see photos will be well worn. They will be well programmed, with known inputs, and predictable outputs. The algorithm will be able to deliver exactly what we need, and correctly predict what we will need next. Scheduling up and queuing the next fifty possible scenarios--with exactly the right colors, textures, and meaning. How we see art will be forever changed by the algorithm. Our machines will never see art. Our machines will never know art. Our machines will only be able to transfer the characteristics we see and deliver them into newer, more relevant, timely, and meaningful images. Distilling down the essence of art into binary, and programming us to think this synthetic art is meaningful, and still applies to our physical world. Like I said, I think people like applying artistic image filters to their mobile photos because it is the opposite of augmented reality. They are trying to augment their digital (hopes of reality) presence with the essence of what we (algorithm) think matters to use in the world. This process isn't about training a model to see art like some folks may tell you. It is about distilling down some of the most simple aspects of what our eyes see as art, and give this algorithm to our mobile phones and social networks to apply to the photograph digital logging of our physical reality. It feels like this is about reprogramming people. It is about reprogramming what stimulates you. Automating an algorithmic view of what matters when it comes to art, and applying it to a digital view of matters in our daily worlds, via our social networks. Just one more area of our life where we are allowing algorithms to reprogram us, and bend our reality to be more digital.

&lt;p&gt;I putting some thought into some next steps for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/&quot;&gt;algorithmic rotoscope work&lt;/a&gt;, which is about the training and applying of image style transfer machine learning models. I'm talking with Jason Toy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jtoy&quot;&gt;@jtoy&lt;/a&gt;) over at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somatic.io/&quot;&gt;Somatic&lt;/a&gt; about the variety of use cases, and I want to spend some thinking about image style transfers, from the perspective of a collector or curator of images--brainstorming how they can organize, make available their work(s) for use in image style transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's start with the basics--what am I talking about when I say image style transfer? &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kinlane.com/2017/02/15/what-do-you-mean-when-you-say-you-are-training-a-machine-learning-model/&quot;&gt;I recommend starting with a basic definition of machine learning in this context, providing by my girlfriend, and partner in crime Audrey Watters&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond, that I am just referring to the training a machine learning model by directing it to scan an image. This model can then be applied to other images, essentially transferring the style of one image, to any other image. There are a handful of mobile applications out there right now that let you apply a handful of filters to images taken with your mobile phone--&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somatic.io/&quot;&gt;Somatic is looking to be the wholesale provider of these features&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training one of these models isn't cheap. It costs me about $20 per model in GPUs to create--this doesn't consider my time, just my hard compute costs (AWS bill). Not every model does anything interesting. Not all images, photos, and pieces of art translate&amp;nbsp;into cool features when applied to images. I've spent about $700 training 35 filters. Some of them are cool, and some of them are meh. I've had the most luck focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/01/03/finding-the-right-dystopian-filter-to-represent-the-world-unfolding-around-us/&quot;&gt;dystopian landscapes&lt;/a&gt;, which I can use in my storytelling around topics like &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/06/algorithmic-reflections-on-the-immigration-debate/&quot;&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt;, technology, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/14/the-russian-propaganda-distortion-field-around-the-white-house/&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work ended up with Jason and I talking about museums and library collections, thinking about opportunities for them to think about their collections in terms of machine learning, and specifically algorithmic style transfer. Do you have images in your collection that would translate well for use in graphic design, print, and digital photo applications? I spend hours looking through art books for the right textures, colors and outlines. I also spend hours looking through graphic design archives for movie and gaming industry, as well as government collections. Looking for just the right set of images that will either transfer&amp;nbsp;and produce an interesting look, as well as possible transfer something meaningful to the new images that I am applying styles to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes style transfers just make a photo look cool, bringing some general colors, textures, and other features to a new photo--there really isn't any value in knowing what image was behind the style transfer, it just looks cool. Other times, the image can be enhanced knowing about the image behind the machine learning model, and not just transferring&amp;nbsp;styles between images, but also potentially transferring some meaning as well. You can see this in action when I took &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/06/algorithmic-reflections-on-the-immigration-debate/&quot;&gt;a nazi propaganda poster and applied to it to photo of Ellis Island&lt;/a&gt;, or I took an &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/02/14/the-russian-propaganda-distortion-field-around-the-white-house/&quot;&gt;old Russian propaganda poster and applied to images of the White House&lt;/a&gt;. I a sense, I was able to transfer some of the 1000 words applied to the propaganda posters and transfer them to new photos I had taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to think you will make a new image into a piece of art by training a model on a piece of art and transferring it's characteristics to a new image using machine learning. Where I find the real value is actually understanding collections of images, while also being aware of the style transfer process, and thinking about how images can be trained and applied. However, this only gets you so far, there has to still be some value or meaning in how it's being applied, accomplishing a specific objective and delivering some sort of meaning. If you are doing this as part of some graphic design work it will be different than if you are doing for fun on a mobile phone app with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further stimulate my imagination and awareness I'm looking through a variety of open image collections, from a variety of institutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on developing specific categories that have relevance to the storytelling I'm doing across my blogs, and sometimes to help power my&amp;nbsp;partners work as well. I'm currently mining the following areas, looking for interesting images to train style transfer machine learning models:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt; - The obvious usage for all of this, finding interesting pieces of art that make your photos look cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Game -&lt;/strong&gt; I find video game imagery to provide a wealth of ideas for training and applying image style transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science Fiction &lt;/strong&gt;- Another rich source of imagery for the&amp;nbsp;training of image style transfer models that do cool things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical&lt;/strong&gt; - I'm finding circuit boards, lighting, and other electrical imagery to be useful in training models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial&lt;/strong&gt; - I'm finding industrial images to work for both sides of the equation in training and applying models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propaganda&lt;/strong&gt; - These are great for training models, and then transferring the texture and the meaning behind them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labor&lt;/strong&gt; - Similar to propaganda posters, potentially some emotional work here that would transfer significant meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space&lt;/strong&gt; - A new one I'm adding for finding interesting imagery that can train models, and experiencing what the effect is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look through more collections, and gain experience training style transfer models, and applying models, I have begun to develop an eye for what looks good. I also develop more ideas along the way of imagery that can help reinforce the storytelling I'm doing across my work. It is a journey I am hoping more librarians, museum curators, and collection stewards will embark on. I don't think you need to learn the inner workings of machine learning, but at least develop enough of an understanding that you can think more critically about the collection you are knowledgeable about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;padding: 15px;&quot; src=&quot;http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/propaganda_poster_transfer_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Jason would like to help you, and I'm more than happy to help you along in the process. Honestly, the biggest hurdle is money to afford the GPUs for training the image. After that, it is about spending the time finding images to train models, as well as to apply the models to a variety of imagery, as part of some sort of meaningful process. I can spend days looking through art collection, then spend a significant amount of AWS budget training machine learning models, but if I don't have a meaningful way to apply them, it doesn't bring any value to the table, and it's unlikely I will be able to justify the budget in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My algorithmic rotoscope work is used throughout my writing&amp;nbsp;and helps influence the stories I tell on &lt;a href=&quot;http://apievangelist.com&quot;&gt;API Evangelist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kinlane.com&quot;&gt;Kin Lane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dronerecovery.org&quot;&gt;Drone Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;http://contrafabulists.com&quot;&gt;Contrafabulists&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I am having a difficult time reconciling what is going on with the White House right now. The distortion field around the administration right now feels like some bad acid trip from the 1980s, before I learned how to find the good LSD. After losing their shit over her emails and Benghazi, they are willing to overlook Russia fucking with our election on so many levels and infiltrating the White House. Wacky. Just fucking wacky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Russia has fed the poor folk in this country a steady diet of bullshit is pretty crafty, as well as disturbing. Their approach to disinformation has dovetailed nicely with the approach of the GOP in this country. As usual, I am trying to understand and visualize the algorithmic distortion in this conversation, and how our current administration could be so heavily under the influence of Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going through Russian propaganda archives looking for the right colors and textures to shine a light on the algorithmic distortion raining down on the White House as part of this ongoing&amp;nbsp;Russian cyber attack. I'm using the posters I've found to train some machine learning models, and the first one has come off the cloud pipeline and was ready for applying to some images to see what the effect might be. I started with a couple photos I've taken of the White House. One from the lawn, and one from inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) while I was working there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the results. It makes it look like the distortion field around the White House are just dense pamphlets raining down from above, dens like Internet packets aggregating&amp;nbsp;on a wireless&amp;nbsp;network fighting to get in. It's fascinating to watch people be so willfully ignorant to see the algorithmic distortion around them. Even with all the talk of wireless, mobile, the web, and cyber warfare. They don't see how they are under assault from information and disinformation--something the Russians seem to excel at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 other posters being used to train machine learning models right now. I can only do one at a time and each one takes about 12 hours. Then it will take me about another week or so of applying them to images to find what works and doesn't work with the filters. I have about 40 individual filters currently, and I have been focusing heavily on dystopian textures in the previous round. I am thinking that this round I'll focus on colors and textures I can use to highlight the effects of the cyber on our reality -- I hear it is going to be huge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are increasingly looking through an algorithmic lens when it comes to politics in our everyday lives. I spend a significant portion of my days trying to understand how algorithms are being used to shift how we view and discuss politics. One of the ongoing themes in my research is focused on machine learning, which is an aspect of technology currently being applied to news curation, identifying fake news, all the way to how we monitor and see the world online with images and video.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are painting a real-time picture that colors how we see the physical world around us--something that is increasingly occurring online for many of us. Because many of the creators of algorithms are white men, they often are blind and even willfully ignorant of how their algorithms and technological tools are used for evil purposes. With a focus on revenue and the interests of their investors, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other platforms often do not see (or are willing to turn a blind eye to) how hateful groups are using their platforms to spread misinformation and hate. When you combine this with a lack of awareness when it comes history, we end up in the current situation we find ourselves in with the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my work to understand how algorithms are shaping our world views I am playing with different ways of applying machine learning to my images and videos for use across my storytelling -- I am calling&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/algorotoscope&quot;&gt;@algorotoscope&lt;/a&gt;. It's helping me understand how machine learning works (or not), while also giving me an artistic distraction from the increasingly inhuman world of technology. Taking photos and videos, as well as the process of training and applying the filters gives me relief, allowing me to find some balance in the very toxic digital environment I find myself in today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that we are allowing algorithms to amplify some very hateful views of the world right now, something that is being leveraged to produce some very damaging outcomes in the immigration debate. To help paint a picture of what I'm seeing from my vantage point, I took an old World War II nazi propaganda poster and used it to train a machine learning model, which I could then apply to any image or video using a platform called &lt;a href=&quot;http://algorithmia.io&quot;&gt;Algorithmia&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the resulting image....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is a photo I took from the waiting area at Ellis Island, with sunlight reflecting through the windows, lighting up the tiles in the room where millions of immigrants waiting to be admitted into this country. I feel like we are allowing our willful ignorance of history as Americans to paint the immigration debate today, something that is being accelerated and fueled by a small hateful portion of our society, with the assistance of algorithms. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms are allowing their algorithms to be gamed by this very vocal minority in a way that is shaping the views of the larger population--making for a very destructive and divisive debate about something very core to our country's origin -- immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are going to get to the bottom of this recent shift in how we operate as a society, we are going to have to work to shine a light on how these algorithms are operating, and how advertising is incentivizing platforms to be blind to their damaging effects. We are allowing algorithms and digital technology to reflect and amplify the worst within us&amp;nbsp;and pushing us to be more polarized.

Thinking about the digital bits that I create, the bits I generate automatically, the bits I own, the bits I do not own, and how I can make a living with just a handful of my bits. I have an inbox full of people who want me to put my bits on their websites, and people who want to put their bits on my platform&amp;nbsp;so that they are associated with my brand, increasing the value of their bits. I know people think I'm crazy (I am) when I talk so much about my bits in this way, but it is a just response to my front-row seat watching companies getting pretty wealthy off all of our bits. #BlueManGroup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is not a new phenomenon, and we've heard stories about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7341570/prince-death-legal-legacy-contract-fights-copyright-battles&quot;&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/11/artsfeatures3&quot;&gt;John Fogerty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/06/06/154451399/george-clinton-fights-for-his-right-to-funk&quot;&gt;George Clinton fighting for the funk&lt;/a&gt; and ownership of their musical bits, something artists of all types have had to battle on all fronts, throughout their careers. Lately, I have I have found myself sucked in listening to stories from Carrie Fisher in her documentaries, better understanding her struggles to maintain a voice in the merchandising, representation and control over her likeness, and her most famous role--Princess Leia. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/princess_leia_blue_circuit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;95%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrie Fisher made Prince Leia the icon she is today. However, she did it on the LucasFilm platform. How much does LucasFilm own, and how much does Carrie Fisher own? How dependent are they on her, and how dependent is she on them. Something that has been intensely&amp;nbsp;worked out between lawyers since the 1970's. Now that she has passed, I'm sure her estate will continue to take on LucasFilm on this front, but the company has so many of her video, audio, and images (her bits), that they can possibly recreate her for future movies if they desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm thinking about my own bits, and the control, or lack of control I have over these this week, I'm also reading that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwars.com/news/a-statement-regarding-new-rumors&quot;&gt;Lucasfilm released a statement that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to assure our fans that Lucasfilm has no plans to digitally recreate Carrie Fisher&amp;rsquo;s performance as Princess or General Leia Organa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/494288/opinion-the-problem-with-the-tupac-hologram&quot;&gt;Tupac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/bbma-2014/6092040/michael-jackson-hologram-billboard-music-awards&quot;&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt; holograms? The precedent for digitally recreate all of&amp;nbsp;or the parts of pieces (bits) of a human is&amp;nbsp;out there. Let me stop here. I'm not talking about anything remotely in realm of the singularity, I'm simply talking about what is possible with existing technology using video, audio, images, and text content generated from or containing the fingerprint of a certain human being (me). I know that some geeks love to masturbate to this shit, but I'm just talking about some of you delusion mother-fuckers realizing there is a lot of money to be off of someone else's hard work, or even just their human existence. #Exploitatification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platformification of everything is all about getting people to come do shit on your platform, and making money doing this--I just happen to study this stuff for a living&amp;nbsp;and possess a borderline unhealthy obsession on the subject (#help). Carrie Fisher had to learn the hard way how to fight for what is hers, back when she was a young adult, something that continued throughout her life. With advances in technology this battle has evolved, morphed, and changed, with the greatest amount of control and power always existing in the hands of the platform (Lucasfilm) operator, who has the most lawyers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you publish anything on the web regularly you know that there are folks who immediately copy your shit and post elsewhere, trying to generate ad revenue--this is the lowest level of things out there. At the higher levels, we have Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and others who want all your bits in their walled garden, where they can measure, track and run your bits through their &quot;machine learning&quot; and &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; algorithms (go&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/11/evernote-reaffirming-our-commitment-to-your-privacy/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;). Where they obtain a license and control over your videos, images, audio and other objects. Where their machine learning can learn to write like you, understand your behavior, where you go, what you like to buy, where you eat, and what you like to read and watch, think, and write in your journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point can Facebook or Google launch an API channel that behaves just like what I perform as the API Evangelist. At what point can Amazon understand which algorithms are getting the most use, the most traction, and awareness, and access to the most data and content, and recreate all of this for themselves, within their domain, presented as the latest AWS offering. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-to-steal-an-ai/&quot;&gt;You know why platform operators are afraid of folks stealing their AI through APIs?&lt;/a&gt; Because it is the reverse of their business model, training their algorithms using your bits, and providing a plantation for developers to tend to, cultivate, and grow the best crops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I am a human being, and no amount of AI, machine learning, and algorithms will ever replace me, and what I do, but it doesn't mean that there won't be endless corporations willing to step up and exploit, profit from my existence as said human being. &lt;a href=&quot;http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/&quot;&gt;As I struggle to understand my digital self&lt;/a&gt;, and make ends meet for my physical self, I just had to take pause, and point out that a corporation just promised to a bunch of human beings that they would not be digitally recreating another beloved human being, simply so they could profit from the hard work she did as a living human being.

Images, files, and the input and output of heavy object is an essential part of almost any machine learning task, and Algorithmia makes easy to do across the storage platforms we use the most (hopefully).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmia provides you with local data storage--pretty standard stuff, but they also allow you to connect your Amazon S3 account, or your Dropbox account, and connect to specific folders, buckets, while helping you handle all of your permissions. Maybe I have my blinders on with this because I heavily use Amazon S3 as me default online storage, and Dropbox is my secondary store, but I think the concept still is worth sharing..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows me to seamlessly manage the objects, documents, files, and other images I store across my operation as part of my machine learning workflow. &amp;nbsp;Algorithmia even provides you with an intuitive way of referencing files, by allowing each Data URI to uniquely identifies files and directories, with each composed of a protocol and a path, with each service having its own unique protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;data:// &lt;/strong&gt;Algorithmia hosted data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dropbox:// &lt;/strong&gt;Dropbox default connected accounts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach dramatically simplifies my operations when working with files, and allows me to leverage the API driven storage services I am already putting to work, while also taking advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://algorithmia.com/algorithms&quot;&gt;the growing number of algorithms available to me in Algorithmia's catalog&lt;/a&gt;. In my algorithmic rotoscope project I am breaking videos into individual images, producing 60 images per second of video, and uploading to Amazon S3. Once images are uploaded, I can then run Algorithmia's Deep Filter algorithm against all images, sometimes thousands of images, using their text models, or any of the 25+ I've trained myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is not limited to just video and images, this is generic to any sort of API driven machine learning orchestration. Just swap out video and images, with mapping, content, or other resource, and then find the relevant machine learning workflow you need to apply, and get to work. While I am having fun playing with my drone videos and texture filters, the approach can be just as easily applied to streamline any sort of marchine learning workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional benefit of storing data this way is I've found Dropbox to be a really amazing layer for including humans in the workflow. I leverage Amazon S3 for my wholesale, compute grade storage, but Dropbox is where I publish images, videos, and documents that I need to put in front of humans, or include them in the machine learning workflow. I find this gives them a role in the process, in a way that gives them control over the data, images, videos, and other objects, on a platform they are already comfortable with. I'd encourage Algorithmia, and other providers to also consider including Google Drive as part of this--it would go a long way logically connected with the human portion of the wokflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I thought Algorithmia's approach to storage was interesting, worth highlight, and something that other providers might consider implementing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kin Lane</name></author><summary type="html">I've been working with Algorithmia to manage a large number of images as part of&amp;nbsp;my algorithmic rotoscope side project, and they have a really nice omni-platform approach to allowing me to manage my images and other files I am using in my machine learning workflows. Images, files, and the input and output of heavy object is an essential part of almost any machine learning task, and Algorithmia makes easy to do across the storage platforms we use the most (hopefully).&amp;nbsp; Algorithmia provides you with local data storage--pretty standard stuff, but they also allow you to connect your Amazon S3 account, or your Dropbox account, and connect to specific folders, buckets, while helping you handle all of your permissions. Maybe I have my blinders on with this because I heavily use Amazon S3 as me default online storage, and Dropbox is my secondary store, but I think the concept still is worth sharing.. This allows me to seamlessly manage the objects, documents, files, and other images I store across my operation as part of my machine learning workflow. &amp;nbsp;Algorithmia even provides you with an intuitive way of referencing files, by allowing each Data URI to uniquely identifies files and directories, with each composed of a protocol and a path, with each service having its own unique protocol: data:// Algorithmia hosted data dropbox:// Dropbox default connected accounts S3:// Amazon S3 default connected account This approach dramatically simplifies my operations when working with files, and allows me to leverage the API driven storage services I am already putting to work, while also taking advantage of the growing number of algorithms available to me in Algorithmia's catalog.
