title: Uncle Sam
description: The image of Uncle Sam is imprinted on my mediocre American imagination. It seems like something that was everywhere when I was a child, but is something that only is just historic myth at this point. However, I feel like Uncle Sam has oozed into everything, leaving a white patina on everything that we can't cover up. Like we left America out in the sun too long.
