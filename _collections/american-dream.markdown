title: American Dream
description: I think a lot about the American Dream. Is it real? Did it only exist during a certain period? Or was it always just a fabricated story that is just out of reach? The American Dream feels like a story to light the fire under our asses in the right moment, but if also feels like a story of exploitation. I am American, so I guess I believe. I mean it feels like it is part of the American club, you have to believe. Even without evidence. 
summary: The American Dream feels like a dream I've woken up from and can't quite remember.
