title: Oakland California
description: I have lived in Oakland, California since April of 2020. I love it. I don't want to live anywhere else. I live downtown. I am captivated by the culture, people, politics, strenth, beauty, and resilience of this town. I want to spend every moment of my life getting to know this place and it's history.
