title: Yellow Journalism
description: I became fascinated by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean culture across the State of California while reading a variety of books and watching different documentaries. Reading about the origins of Oakland's China Town, and the outbreak of bubonic plague in San Franciscoâ€™s Chinatown, left me searching for other realities of being Asian on the west coast of this country. This all got me tuning into the increase in anti-asian hate crimes, and the realities of being Asian on the west coast during Covid. My Yellow Journalism filter and resulting images reflect how I see this digitally amplified layer of our world.
