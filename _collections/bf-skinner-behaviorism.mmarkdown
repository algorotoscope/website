title: BF Skinner Behaviorism
description: I learned about BF Skinner and behaviorism through my wife's work. As I learned about how behaviorism was dismissed as something of the past, while simultaneously being a ubiquitous aspect of how we deliver technology online today, I found myself thinking about the role APIs play in all of this. These photos reflect he behaviorism that is baked just beneath the surface of the technology we depend on each day on our mobile phones and online platforms we spend our time. Revealing how much of what I do in the tech space is just about behavioral conditioning.
